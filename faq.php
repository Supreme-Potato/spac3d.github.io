			<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">chevron_right</i><b>How are 360-degree Virtual Tours hosted?</b></div>
			<div class="collapsible-body"><span>Your virtual tour will be hosted through an external site either Cupix/Round Me. You will be able to customize where it goes and the size in which it is displayed. You can also add your tour to your Google Business Listing.</span></div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">chevron_right</i><b>How long will you be on site to take the 360-degree Panoramic Photography?</b></div>
			<div class="collapsible-body"><span>The time it takes to take the photographs for your tour will vary depending on the size of your establishment. We will be able to give you an estimate based on your requirements. Generally speaking a single small room will take 10 minutes to photgraph.</span></div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">chevron_right</i><b>Will the tours run on different devices?</b></div>
			<div class="collapsible-body"><span>Yes. The software behind the tours has been designed to accomodate the user whether they are on a phone, tablet and/or computer.</span></div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">chevron_right</i><b>Must I have an Internet Connection for a Virtual Tour?</b></div>
			<div class="collapsible-body"><span>Yes. Since the virtual tours will be hosted on a website this means that you, or your user, will need a connection to the internet.</span></div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">chevron_right</i><b>What is a 360-degree virtual tour?</b></div>
			<div class="collapsible-body"><span>A 360-degree, or virtual tour, is technically a compilation of 360 photographs that are processed and placed in a way that allows a user to "walk through" an environment. Our 360 camera takes multiple images at one point and stitches them together. This allows a user to look in any direction they choose from where the camera is placed.</span></div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">chevron_right</i><b>What is a hotspot?</b></div>
			<div class="collapsible-body"><span>A hotspot is a specific detail in your environment that you would like to highlight or explain further. Within your virtual tour we can create informational text to be displayed where you see fit. For example if a user is in a hotel room and you would like to showcase where the towels are stored we will implement a hotspot at that location in the 360 image and everytime the user looks at that area a message will be displayed exactly where the towels are located.
				</span></div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">chevron_right</i><b>What kind of businesses benefit more from virtual tours?</b></div>
			<div class="collapsible-body"><span>Any business that has clients frequent their premises will benefit from a virtual tour. Most of our clients are restaurants, hotels and b&amp;b's but we also do work for office spaces.
				</span></div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">chevron_right</i><b>What is the difference between Cupix and Round Me?
				</b></div>
			<div class="collapsible-body"><span>Cupix and Round Me are the softwares we use to generate and host our virtual tours. <br> <br>
					Cupix is a lot more in depth and allows for users to walk between virtual points by click an arrow pointing to their desired destination. Cupix will take a longer time to photograph as more virtual points are required in order for the user to truly be able to walk around your establishment. <br> <br>

					Round Me allows you to showcase your highlighted points rather than having the user try and find them. You will be able to choose which areas you would like to showcase and the user will be able to select which area they would like to see. <br> <br>

					<i>For a comparison please look at our <a href="portfolio.php">Portfolio page.</a> </i>

			<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">chevron_right</i><b>What is the virtual tour design process?</b></div>
			<div class="collapsible-body"><span>
					<ol>
						<li>We will create a plan that covers what virtual tour software you would prefer and what you would like to showcase. If you would like a more accurate quote, we will happily come in to assess your establishment with you.</li>
						<li>We will discuss a date with you as to when we can come in to photograph (you will need to move people out of the way and have your areas cleaned to your liking)</li>
						<li>We will come in an take the photographs of the agreed areas (we will discuss the time it will take in the planning stage)</li>
						<li>We will edit and create your virtual tour (the time this takes will also be communicated to you in the planning stage)</li>
						<li> Once the virtual tour is completed we will send you a link for revision. If there is something you would like adjusted, or if you would like areas to be re-photographed, we will happily make the changes.</li>
						<li>Once you are happy with the virtual tour we will be able to provide you with the HTML code in order to embed the virtual tour onto your website. If we have discussed for the tour to be added to your Google Business Listing, this will be completed in this step too.</li>
