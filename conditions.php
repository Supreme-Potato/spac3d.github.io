If spac3d’s photographer perceives the shoot location as unsafe, he / she reserves the right to stop all work.

		6.2 Once the tours are complete, the images will be made available for client to view on spac3d’s website.

		6.3 Any changes to virtual tour images that are requested after the completion/sign off of project will be charged at R120 per hour. <br>
		6.4 Projects are, on average, completed within 5 working days of the shoot date, providing subsequent information spac3d required was provided in a timely manner (i.e. location names etc). This is based on a project of 10 virtual points. More complex tours will vary in completion times and expected completion dates will be outlined in client quote. <br>
		6.5 Performance varies on different device setups, this also applies to a device’s memory, broadband speed and type of device. Spac3d cannot be held responsible for tours that do not run on some user’s devices. <br>
